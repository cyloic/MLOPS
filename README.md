#  Dog vs Cat Image Classifier

This project demonstrates a complete Machine Learning workflow using image data for a binary classification task â€” identifying whether an image is of a dog or a cat using traditional ML techniques (no deep learning). It includes model training, deployment via Flask and Streamlit, and performance testing using Locust.

The system classifies images of dogs and cats using handcrafted image features and traditional Scikit-learn classifiers. It covers all essential ML lifecycle components:

Feature extraction and model training

Model saving and loading

Real-time predictions through API and UI

Performance monitoring with Locust



- A **Flask API** (`api.py`) for serving predictions
- A **Streamlit UI** (`streamlit_app.py`) for interactive user input
-
